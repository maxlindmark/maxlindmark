Hi! 

My name is Max Lindmark and I am a postdoc at the Institute of Marine Research, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. I have a broad interest in marine ecology, but I have always been especially interested in fish and fisheries ecology. 

My current research aims to understand cod-flounder interactions in the Baltic Sea using survey data using spatio-temporal models, and if changes in these contribute to the poor performance of cod.

For my PhD studies, I worked on understanding the effects of climate warming on individuals and size-structured populations and communities using dynamic models. 

Feel free to contact me if you want to get in touch!
