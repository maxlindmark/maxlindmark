      <description>Hi!
My name is Max Lindmark and I am a PhD Student at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. I&amp;rsquo;m from the west coast of Sweden, and I have a broad interest in marine ecology, ranging from macro ecology to conservation. I have however always been especially interested in fish and fisheries ecology!
For my PhD studies, I want to develop mechanistic understanding, based on metabolic scaling principles, on how climate warming affects individuals and how that affects size-structured populations and communities.</description>
